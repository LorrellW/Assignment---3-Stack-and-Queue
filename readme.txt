          C++/WinRT Assignment 3  Expression Manager (STACK)
========================================================================

An expression manager built using stack that will convert a users expression
from infix to postfix performing multiple checks to ensure correctness of output.

1.Run the program and wait for it to display a prompt.
2.When prompted, enter an infix expression  +, –, *, /, %, {, }, (, ), [, ] 
    are all allowed charcters.
3.The program will perform a Balanced Parentheses Check on the expression.
4.If the expression fails the check, the program will display a message to 
    the user  indicating that the expression is invalid.
5.If the expression passes the check, the program will convert the infix 
    expression into a postfix expression and display it to the user including
    the values entered.
6.The program will then exit.
